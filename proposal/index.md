# SimpleMeals: Product Strategy

## 1. The Problem: "What's for Dinner?"

Every day, millions of households face the same dilemma:
*   **Decision Fatigue**: After a long day, deciding what to cook is mentally exhausting.
*   **Ingredient Constraints**: You open the fridge and see a random assortment of ingredients (e.g., half an onion, some eggs, and a bell pepper) but can't visualize a cohesive meal.
*   **Food Waste**: Perfectly good ingredients go bad because people don't know how to use them before they expire.
*   **Recipe Overload**: searching online for "chicken recipes" yields thousands of results, many of which require ingredients you don't have, leading to grocery runs or frustration.

Most recipe apps are **databases** where you search for what you *want* to cook. They don't help you with what you *have*.

## 2. The Solution: AI-Powered Culinary Creativity

**SimpleMeals** flips the script. Instead of asking "What do I want?", it asks "What do I have?"

### How It Works
1.  **Input**: The user inputs their available ingredients (e.g., "chicken breast, rice, broccoli") or simply **takes a photo** of their fridge/pantry.
2.  **Processing**: The app uses advanced AI (Google Gemini) to understand the ingredients and their potential combinations.
3.  **Generation**: The AI acts as a professional chef, instantly creating unique, step-by-step recipes tailored *exactly* to those specific ingredients.
4.  **Customization**: It adapts to dietary restrictions and offers difficulty levels, prep times, and tips.

**Value Proposition**:
*   **Reduce Waste**: Use what you have, save money.
*   **Save Time**: No more scrolling through ad-heavy recipe blogs.
*   **Confidence**: Cooking becomes accessible, even with limited skills or ingredients.

## 3. Target Audience

*   **The Busy Professional**: Needs quick, healthy meal ideas without the mental load of planning.
*   **The Budget-Conscious Home Cook**: Wants to maximize their groceries and minimize food waste.
*   **The Aspiring Cook**: Wants to learn how to combine flavors but lacks the intuition of a chef.
*   **Parents**: Need family-friendly meals that use up the leftovers in the fridge.

## 4. Monetization Strategy

SimpleMeals utilizes a **Freemium Subscription Model** to balance accessibility with revenue generation.

### Free Tier (Acquisition & Retention)
*   **Access**: Free to download and use.
*   **Limitation**: 3 AI-generated recipes per day.
*   **Goal**: Demonstrate value. The user experiences the "magic" of turning random ingredients into a recipe. The limit is generous enough for occasional use but restrictive for daily reliance. "Hook the user with the utility."

### SimpleMeals Pro (Monetization)
*   **Pricing**: Monthly and Yearly subscription options (managed via RevenueCat).
*   **Benefits**:
    *   **Unlimited Recipe Generations**: Cook as much as you want.
    *   **Ad-Free Experience** (if ads are introduced later).
    *   **Premium AI Models**: Access to more advanced or creative AI models (future feature).
    *   **Save History**: Unlimited history of generated recipes.
*   **Conversion Trigger**: The "Daily Limit Reached" paywall. When a user hits their 3rd recipe, they are prompted to upgrade, capitalizing on the moment of highest intent.
